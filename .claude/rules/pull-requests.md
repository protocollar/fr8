# Pull Request Guidelines

## Description Format

Use the What/Why/How structure:

```markdown
## What
Brief description of the changes (1-2 sentences).

## Why
Business or engineering goal this addresses. Link to Linear issue if applicable.

## How
Significant implementation decisions or trade-offs (omit for simple changes).

## Screenshots
<!-- For UI changes only - delete if not applicable -->
```

## Writing Guidelines

- **Be explicit** - Don't just say "Fixes #123", explain what was fixed
- **Why > What** - Reviewers can read the code; explain the reasoning
- **Keep it scannable** - Use bullet points over paragraphs
- **Link issues after context** - Reference GitHub issues, but explain first

## Pre-flight Criteria

Before creating a PR, verify:

1. All changes are committed (no uncommitted work)
2. Branch is pushed to remote with `-u` flag
3. PR leaves the app in a stable state (not broken)
